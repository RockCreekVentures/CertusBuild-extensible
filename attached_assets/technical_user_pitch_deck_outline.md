### Slide 2: We Understand Your Daily Grind

*   **Headline:** Tired of Drowning in Documents & Disconnected Data?
*   **Acknowledge User Pain Points (from user feedback & `certusbuild_mvp_research.md`):
    *   **The Bid Scramble:** Hours/days lost deciphering massive RFP/solicitation documents (4000+ pages!).
    *   **Estimation Headaches:** Difficulty in creating accurate *duration* estimates; cost estimates not well-linked to time; managing uncertainty feels like guesswork.
    *   **Disconnected Tools:** Juggling spreadsheets, separate scheduling software, and generic document viewers.
    *   **Risk of Errors:** Manual data entry and information transfer leading to mistakes.
    *   **Lack of Clarity:** Difficulty visualizing the impact of changes on both schedule and budget simultaneously.
*   **Visual:** A relatable image of a frustrated estimator/PM with piles of paper, or a complex, messy workflow diagram.

### Slide 3: Introducing CertusBuild: Your New Workflow Co-Pilot

*   **Headline:** Work Smarter, Not Harder, with CertusBuild.
*   **Core Concept:** CertusBuild is an AI-powered platform designed *by* construction professionals *for* construction professionals to simplify complex tasks and provide actionable insights.
*   **Focus on the MVP: Intelligent Bid Preparation & Integrated Estimation Suite.**
    *   **1. AI-Powered Document Intake:** Let CertusBuild do the heavy lifting on bid documents.
    *   **2. Integrated Estimation Hub:** Seamlessly connect scope, time, cost, and risk in one place.
    *   **3. Clearer Insights, Better Decisions:** Understand your estimates and project risks like never before.
*   **Visual:** A clean, inviting mockup of the CertusBuild workspace (can use `certusbuild_dark_mode_wireframe_with_logo.png` as a base, perhaps with callouts to key features).

### Slide 4: Deep Dive: AI-Powered Bid Document Analysis

*   **Headline:** From 4000 Pages to Actionable Insights in Minutes, Not Days.
*   **How it Works (User-Friendly Language):
    *   **Upload & Process:** Simply upload your solicitation documents (PDFs, Word, etc.).
    *   **Intelligent Extraction:** Our AI reads and understands the documents, automatically identifying:
        *   Key scope items and deliverables.
        *   Critical specifications and requirements.
        *   Potential risks and ambiguities.
        *   Preliminary Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) suggestions.
    *   **Output:** A clear, organized summary and an initial project structure ready for estimation.
*   **User Benefit:** "Spend less time sifting through documents and more time strategizing your bid."
*   **Visual:** A before-and-after concept: on one side, a huge stack of papers; on the other, a clean CertusBuild interface showing extracted key info and a structured WBS. (Could use elements from `wireframe_concept_1_modular.png` for the structured output).

### Slide 5: Deep Dive: The Integrated Estimation Hub - Durations & Resources

*   **Headline:** Finally, Durations and Costs That Speak the Same Language.
*   **Workflow (Focus on ease of use and integration):
    *   **Refine WBS:** Easily adjust the AI-suggested WBS or build from scratch with intuitive task definition and dependency linking.
    *   **Quantity Takeoff (Future: AI-Assisted):** Link tasks to quantities (manual input for MVP, future AI from drawings).
    *   **Resource-Driven Durations:** Assign crews, equipment, and define productivity rates. See durations calculate automatically.
    *   **Visual Scheduling (Simplified Gantt):** A clear, interactive view of your project timeline as it develops.
*   **User Benefit:** "No more disconnected spreadsheets for time and cost. Build a realistic schedule based on your actual resources and scope."
*   **Visual:** Mockup of the CertusBuild estimation interface showing a WBS, resource allocation panel, and a dynamically updating Gantt chart view (referencing `buildertrend_scheduling_tutorial_gantt.png` for style inspiration but within CertusBuild UI).

### Slide 6: Deep Dive: Integrated Costing & Built-in Uncertainty Management

*   **Headline:** Estimate with Confidence: Understand Your True Cost & Risk.
*   **Workflow (Continued):
    *   **Automatic Costing:** As resources are assigned and durations defined, costs are automatically calculated based on your rates (or industry data).
    *   **Simple Uncertainty Input:** For critical tasks, easily input Optimistic, Most Likely, and Pessimistic estimates for duration and/or cost (no complex stats needed!).
    *   **Instant Risk Insights:** CertusBuild runs simulations (behind the scenes) to show you:
        *   A likely range for your total project duration and cost (e.g., P50, P80).
        *   Which tasks are driving the most risk.
*   **User Benefit:** "Move beyond single-point estimates. Understand the potential variability in your projects and identify high-risk areas *before* you bid."
*   **Visual:** Mockup showing a cost breakdown alongside the schedule, with a simple risk profile chart (e.g., a probability distribution curve for project completion or cost).

---

### Slide 7: Scenario Analysis: What If...?

*   **Headline:** Explore Options, Optimize Your Plan.
*   **Functionality:
    *   Easily duplicate estimates to try different approaches.
    *   What if we use a different crew size? What if material costs increase?
    *   Instantly see the impact of changes on the overall schedule, cost, and risk profile.
*   **User Benefit:** "Quickly compare different strategies and make informed decisions to create the most competitive and realistic bid or project plan."
*   **Visual:** A split-screen mockup showing two versions of an estimate with different parameters and resulting outputs.
