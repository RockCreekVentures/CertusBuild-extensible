# Brand Name & Domain Availability Synthesis

## 1. Summary of Findings

Following the brainstorming session based on your criteria (reliability, quality, efficiency, trust; abstract/compound; <10 chars), a shortlist of 18 potential brand names was generated. Domain availability checks using the `whois` tool were performed for the preferred `.com` extension for each name on the shortlist.

**Key Finding:** Based on the `whois` records retrieved, **all 18 candidate `.com` domains appear to be registered and are currently unavailable.** This is common for shorter, evocative, or industry-relevant names.

*   **Domains Checked (All Appear Taken):** trubuild.com, vericost.com, sureplan.com, coreplan.com, anchorpm.com, plumbline.com, levelset.com, flowbuild.com, conflow.com, optibuild.com, nexuscm.com, buildwise.com, axiobuild.com, fulcrumcm.com, alinea.com, koretex.com, centricon.com, navixcm.com.

*(Raw `whois` output is available in `domain_checks.txt`)*

## 2. Recommendations & Next Steps

Given that the initial `.com` targets are unavailable, we have several options:

1.  **Explore Alternative TLDs:** Revisit the shortlisted names and check availability for other relevant Top-Level Domains (TLDs) you mentioned being potentially acceptable, such as `.io`, `.ai`, `.build`, or `.tech`. For example, `TruBuild.io` or `AxioBuild.ai` might be available.
2.  **Modify Existing Names:** Consider slight modifications to the shortlisted names. This could involve adding a prefix/suffix (e.g., `GoTruBuild.com`, `CorePlanHQ.com`) or tweaking the spelling (though this can impact memorability).
3.  **Brainstorm New Names:** Generate a new list of names, potentially exploring slightly longer options (if the <10 character limit is flexible), different keyword combinations, or more unique abstract concepts.
4.  **Consider Acquisition:** If a specific taken `.com` domain is highly desirable, investigating acquisition through a domain broker is an option, although this can be costly and time-consuming.

**Recommendation:** Before proceeding with further design refinement, it would be beneficial to explore **Option 1 (Alternative TLDs)** for the existing shortlist or **Option 3 (Brainstorm New Names)**. Please let me know which path you prefer, or if you have other ideas.
