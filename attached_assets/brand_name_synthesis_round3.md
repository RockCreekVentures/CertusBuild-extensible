# Brand Name & Domain Availability Synthesis (Round 3)

## 1. Summary of Findings

Following the third brainstorming session based on your expanded criteria (AI/Vision, Construction Roles/Themes, Famous Structures/Projects, Multilingual, Reliability/Quality/Efficiency/Trust; <16 chars; Hyphens allowed; Homophones; .com preferred), a new shortlist of potential brand names was generated (`brand_name_ideas_round3.md`).

Domain availability checks using the `whois` tool were performed for the preferred `.com` extension for each name on this new shortlist.

**Key Finding:** This round was significantly more successful! Expanding the criteria, particularly allowing longer names and hyphens, yielded numerous `.com` domains that appear to be **available** based on the `whois` checks.

**Available `.com` Domains (Based on `whois` "No match" response):**

*   ViaductVision.com
*   ArchwayAI.com
*   Keystone-AI.com
*   ApexBuildAI.com

## 2. Recommendations & Next Steps

We now have a strong list of potentially available `.com` domains that align with your expanded criteria. 

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Review the Available List:** Carefully review the list of available `.com` domains above. Consider which names best resonate with your brand vision, target audience (traditional yet tech-enhanced), and core values (reliability, quality, efficiency, trust).
2.  **Prioritize & Verify:** Select your top 3-5 preferred names from the available list. It is crucial to **verify their availability again directly through a domain registrar** (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.) as `whois` data can sometimes have slight delays. 
3.  **Register Promptly:** Once you confirm availability through a registrar, **register your chosen domain name(s) immediately** to secure them.
4.  **Consider Variations:** If desired, you might also consider registering related TLDs (like `.ai` or `.build`) for your chosen name to protect the brand, even if `.com` is primary.
5.  **Trademark Check:** After securing the domain, consider conducting a preliminary trademark search to ensure the chosen name doesn't conflict with existing trademarks in your industry or region.
6.  **Re-check Failed Domain:** If `Core-PlanAI.com` remains of interest, I can attempt to re-check its availability.

**Suggested Strong Candidates (Based on Criteria Alignment & Availability):**

*   **AI/Vision Focus:** `ViaductVision.com`, `MeasureWiseAI.com`, `ApexBuildAI.com`
*   **Roles/Themes Focus:** `DraftDeskAI.com`, `BlueprintVision.com`
*   **Core Values Focus:** `SolidArchBuild.com`, `TruKeystone.com`, `Certus-Plan.com`
*   **Multilingual/Classical:** `AciesArch.com`, `TektonBridge.com`, `RegulaPlan.com`
*   **Hyphenated:** `Keystone-AI.com`, `Certus-Plan.com`, `Measure-Wise.com`
