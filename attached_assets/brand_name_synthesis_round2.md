# Brand Name & Domain Availability Synthesis (Round 2)

## 1. Summary of Findings

Following the second brainstorming session based on your expanded criteria (AI/Vision, Construction Roles/Themes, Multilingual Inspiration, Reliability, Quality, Efficiency, Trust; Abstract/Compound; <10 chars), a new shortlist of 23 potential brand names was generated (`brand_name_ideas_round2.md`).

Domain availability checks using the `whois` tool were performed again for the preferred `.com` extension for each name on this new shortlist.

**Key Finding:** Similar to the first round, the `whois` records retrieved indicate that **all 23 candidate `.com` domains from the second shortlist also appear to be registered and are currently unavailable.**

*   **Domains Checked (Round 2 - All Appear Taken):** visiobuild.com, buildsight.com, formaai.com, opticbuild.com, accusight.com, intelbuild.com, acubuild.com, sightplan.com, visiocore.com, draftplan.com, measureai.com, aciesbuild.com, formabuild.com, faberplan.com, structai.com, certusplan.com, metronplan.com, tektonai.com, skoposbuild.com, blickbuild.com, sichtplan.com, vistabuild.com, construai.com.

*(Raw `whois` output is available in `domain_checks_round2.txt`)*

## 2. Recommendations & Next Steps

The challenge of finding available, short, meaningful `.com` domains is evident. We still have several viable paths forward:

1.  **Explore Alternative TLDs:** Systematically check the availability of names from **both Round 1 and Round 2 shortlists** using alternative TLDs like `.ai` (very relevant given the tech angle), `.io`, `.build`, `.tech`, or `.co`.
2.  **Modify Existing Names:** Brainstorm variations of the strongest candidates from both rounds (e.g., `AciesBuildAI.com`, `VisioCore.build`, `CertusPlan.io`).
3.  **Brainstorm New Names (Round 3):** Generate a third list, perhaps relaxing the character limit slightly (e.g., up to 12 characters), using different keyword combinations, or focusing even more heavily on unique abstract or multilingual options.
4.  **Consider Acquisition:** Keep this as a less preferred option due to potential cost and complexity.

**Recommendation:** Given the strong relevance of AI, **Option 1 (Explore Alternative TLDs)**, particularly checking `.ai` and `.build` for the most promising names from both rounds, seems like a logical next step. Alternatively, **Option 3 (Brainstorm New Names - Round 3)** with slightly relaxed constraints could yield results. Please let me know which path you prefer.
