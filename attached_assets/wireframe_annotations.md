# Workspace Wireframe Concepts & Annotations

This document describes two initial wireframe concepts for the core workspace of the construction management SaaS platform, based on the research into modern UI paradigms (dashboards, IDEs, creative suites) and the requirement to balance professional aesthetics with intuitive usability.

## Concept 1: Modular IDE-Style Layout (`wireframe_concept_1_modular.png`)

**Rationale:** This concept draws heavily from Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and some creative software, prioritizing flexibility and information density for power users like estimators, engineers, and project managers who might spend extended periods in the application.

**Annotations:**

1.  **Top Bar:** Standard location for global navigation, application title/logo, user profile/settings, and potentially global search or notifications.
2.  **Left Panel (Collapsible):** Serves as the primary navigation and project/file browser. Users can navigate between different modules (Dashboard, Projects, Tasks, Estimating, Scheduling, Reports, Settings, etc.) and browse project-specific files or data structures (e.g., BIM models, cost databases, schedules). Collapsibility maximizes the main content area.
3.  **Main Content Area (Center):** The primary workspace. Its content changes based on the selected module/task. In this example, it shows a dashboard view with summary widgets, but it could display a detailed estimate, a Gantt chart, a BIM viewer, or document editing tools. This area is designed to be the main focus.
4.  **Right Panel (Collapsible):** Context-sensitive panel providing details, properties, or actions related to the item selected in the main content area. For example, selecting a task in a schedule might show its details, dependencies, and assigned resources here. Selecting an element in a BIM model could show its properties. Collapsibility allows users to hide it when not needed.
5.  **Bottom Panel (Collapsible/Tabbed):** Area for logs, console output, notifications, background task status, or potentially communication/chat features. Similar to IDEs, this provides persistent access to system feedback or secondary information streams without cluttering the main view. Could be tabbed for different types of information.

**UX Considerations:**
*   **Flexibility:** Users could potentially resize or even rearrange panels (though this adds complexity).
*   **Focus:** Keeps the main task central, with navigation and details accessible but tuckable.
*   **Scalability:** Suitable for complex workflows involving multiple data sources or views.
*   **Learning Curve:** Might feel familiar to users of technical software but could be slightly intimidating initially for less technical users.

## Concept 2: Dashboard-Centric Layout (`wireframe_concept_2_dashboard.png`)

**Rationale:** This concept leans more towards modern web dashboards, prioritizing at-a-glance information and key metrics. It might be more suitable as a default landing page or for roles like executives or finance staff who need high-level overviews.

**Annotations:**

1.  **Top Bar:** Similar to Concept 1, for global navigation, branding, user controls.
2.  **Left Panel (Collapsible):** Simplified navigation, potentially focusing on core modules or projects. Less emphasis on deep file structures compared to Concept 1.
3.  **Main Content Area (Center):** Dominated by configurable widgets displaying KPIs, charts, task lists, recent activity, etc. Provides a customizable overview of project status or user-specific information.
4.  **Right Panel (Collapsible):** Similar context-sensitive details panel as in Concept 1, providing more information about selected items (e.g., details of a task clicked in the Task List widget).
5.  **Bottom Panel:** Omitted or integrated differently (e.g., notifications might appear transiently or be accessed via an icon in the top bar) to maximize dashboard space and reduce visual complexity.

**UX Considerations:**
*   **Clarity:** Excellent for quick status checks and identifying key metrics.
*   **Customization:** Widgets could be added, removed, or rearranged by the user.
*   **Approachability:** Generally feels more familiar and less complex than the IDE layout for a wider range of users.
*   **Task Depth:** Might require navigating away from the dashboard or opening modals/new views for detailed tasks (like complex estimating or scheduling), potentially leading to more context switching for power users compared to Concept 1.

*Next steps involve exploring visual themes (color palettes, typography, iconography) for these structures.*
