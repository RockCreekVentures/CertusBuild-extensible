# CertusBuild Wireframe Annotations

## Overview
These annotations correspond to the initial wireframe concepts for the CertusBuild platform. The wireframes focus on the estimation and scheduling modules, with special attention to creating an intuitive and efficient user experience for construction professionals.

## Wireframe Concept 1: Modular Workspace

### General Layout
1. **Top Navigation Bar**
   - Project selector dropdown (currently showing "Vertex Office Tower")
   - Module navigation tabs (Dashboard, Estimation, Scheduling, Documents, Reports)
   - User profile and settings
   - Notifications center
   - Help and search functions

2. **Left Sidebar**
   - Context-specific navigation based on current module
   - Quick access to frequently used functions
   - Collapsible to maximize working area

3. **Main Content Area**
   - Primary workspace with module-specific content
   - Tabbed interface for managing multiple documents/views simultaneously
   - Responsive design with adjustable panels

4. **Right Context Panel**
   - Properties and details for selected items
   - Related information and quick actions
   - Collapsible to maximize working area

### Estimation Module Specifics

5. **Estimation Grid**
   - Hierarchical line item structure with collapsible sections
   - Inline editing capabilities for efficient data entry
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Column customization options

6. **Takeoff Integration**
   - Split view showing plans alongside estimate items
   - Visual indicators linking measured areas to line items
   - Measurement tools with automatic quantity calculation

7. **Cost Database Panel**
   - Searchable cost item database
   - Drag-and-drop functionality to add items to estimate
   - Recent and favorite items for quick access

8. **Summary Panel**
   - Real-time totals and calculations
   - Markup and contingency controls
   - Visual indicators for budget status

### Scheduling Module Specifics

9. **Gantt Chart View**
   - Interactive timeline with drag-and-drop task management
   - Clear visualization of dependencies and critical path
   - Custom color coding for task categories and status
   - Zoom controls for timeline scale

10. **Resource Assignment Panel**
    - Visual resource allocation overview
    - Drag-and-drop assignment of resources to tasks
    - Resource conflict detection
    - Capacity visualization

11. **Task Details Form**
    - Streamlined input form for task creation and editing
    - Integration with estimation line items
    - Duration calculation assistance
    - Dependency selector with visual feedback

12. **Calendar View Toggle**
    - Alternative calendar visualization of the schedule
    - Day/Week/Month view options
    - Resource-based or task-based viewing modes

## Design Considerations

### Visual Hierarchy
- Strong typographic hierarchy to distinguish between levels of information
- Consistent color system aligned with CertusBuild brand guidelines
- Clear separation between functional areas using subtle borders and background colors
- Visual emphasis on primary actions and important data

### Interaction Design
- Minimal clicks required for common actions
- Consistent interaction patterns across modules
- Intuitive drag-and-drop operations where appropriate
- Contextual tools appearing when needed

### Integration Points
- Clear visual connections between related estimate items and schedule tasks
- Seamless transitions between different modules
- Consistent terminology and naming conventions
- Unified data model preventing redundant entry

### Responsiveness
- Adaptable layout supporting different screen sizes
- Collapsible panels to maximize working area
- Touch-friendly controls for tablet usage
- Priority information remains visible at all screen sizes

## Next Steps

Based on this initial wireframe concept, we recommend:

1. **Usability Testing** with target users to validate key interaction models
2. **Component Detailing** to refine individual UI elements and controls
3. **Interactive Prototyping** to test workflow sequences
4. **Visual Design Application** to apply the full CertusBuild visual identity

Future wireframe iterations will incorporate user feedback and explore alternative approaches to key interactions, particularly around:
- Takeoff-to-estimate workflow
- Schedule dependency management
- Resource allocation visualization
- Mobile/tablet adaptations
