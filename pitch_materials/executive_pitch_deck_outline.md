### Slide 6: The CertusBuild Difference: Why We Stand Out

*   **Headline:** Smarter, Faster, More Integrated.
*   **Key Differentiators (derived from `construction_software_gap_analysis.md` and MVP proposal):
    *   **Deep AI Integration for Bid Prep:** Not just document storage, but intelligent analysis and extraction directly feeding estimation.
    *   **Truly Integrated Time-Cost-Risk:** Holistic estimation, not siloed modules. Probabilistic approach made accessible.
    *   **Designed for Medium-Sized Firms:** Powerful capabilities without the enterprise-level complexity or cost of some competitors (Procore, Autodesk CC can be complex).
    *   **Focus on Pre-Construction Excellence:** Solving the critical upfront challenges that have a cascading impact on project success.
*   **Competitive Landscape (Briefly, from `procore_research.md`, etc.):**
    *   Acknowledge existing players (Procore, Autodesk, Buildertrend).
    *   Highlight how CertusBuild addresses specific gaps they don't fully cover, especially in the integrated AI-bid-prep-to-risk-aware-estimation workflow for the target segment.
