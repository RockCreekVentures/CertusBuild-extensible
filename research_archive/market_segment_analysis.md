## Conclusion

The construction management software market contains several underserved segments that align well with CertusBuild's focus on estimation and scheduling excellence. The mid-market commercial contractor segment represents the most promising initial target, offering substantial market size, clear pain points aligned with our strengths, and reasonable go-to-market accessibility.

By focusing on mid-market firms that have outgrown basic solutions but find enterprise platforms excessive in both cost and complexity, CertusBuild can establish a distinctive market position. The emphasis on connecting estimation and scheduling with uncertainty management directly addresses a critical gap in current offerings across all market segments.

Progressive specialty contractors represent a valuable secondary focus, particularly those dealing with complex estimation challenges and tight resource constraints. Success in these initial segments can provide the foundation for later expansion into adjacent markets such as design-build firms and larger residential builders.
