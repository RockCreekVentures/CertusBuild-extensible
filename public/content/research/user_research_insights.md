# User Research Insights

This document provides key insights from our user research studies conducted with construction professionals to inform the CertusBuild platform design.

## Research Methodology

Our research included:
- In-depth interviews with 18 construction professionals across different roles
- 5 on-site observation sessions
- 3 workflow mapping workshops
- Analysis of 150+ survey responses

## Key Findings

### Pain Points

1. **Time-Consuming Estimation**: Professionals spend 15-20 hours per week on estimation tasks that could be automated
2. **Disconnected Systems**: Data lives in 4-8 different systems that don't talk to each other
3. **Information Silos**: Critical knowledge often resides with individual team members
4. **Inconsistent Processes**: Lack of standardized approaches leads to variable outcomes
5. **Limited Visibility**: Difficult to track progress and identify potential issues early

### User Needs

| Need | Description | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Streamlined Estimation | Reduce time spent on repetitive calculations | High |
| Integrated Workflow | Connect different stages of the construction process | High |
| Real-time Collaboration | Enable team members to work together effectively | Medium |
| Mobile Access | Access critical information on job sites | Medium |
| Historical Data Analysis | Learn from past projects to improve future ones | High |

## Persona Analysis

We identified four key user personas:

### 1. Project Manager

**Characteristics:**
- Responsible for overall project success
- Focused on timeline, budget, and resource allocation
- Needs comprehensive dashboard view of project status
- Pain point: Lack of real-time visibility into project changes

### 2. Estimator

**Characteristics:**
- Creates detailed cost and resource estimates
- Requires accurate historical data for reference
- Pain point: Manual data entry and recalculations

### 3. Field Supervisor

**Characteristics:**
- Manages on-site execution
- Needs mobile access to plans and specifications
- Pain point: Communication delays with office team

### 4. Executive Stakeholder

**Characteristics:**
- Focused on business outcomes and strategic decisions
- Needs high-level reports and performance metrics
- Pain point: Difficult to assess project profitability in real-time

## Recommendations

Based on our research, we recommend:

1. **AI-Assisted Estimation**: Implement machine learning to automate repetitive calculations and suggest optimizations
2. **Unified Platform**: Create a single source of truth for all project information
3. **Mobile-First Approach**: Ensure seamless experience on job sites
4. **Collaborative Features**: Enable real-time information sharing and updates
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide actionable insights based on historical and current data

## Next Steps

- Develop detailed user journey maps
- Create clickable prototypes for key workflows
- Conduct usability testing with target users
