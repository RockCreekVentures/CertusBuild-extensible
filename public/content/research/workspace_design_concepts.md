# CertusBuild Workspace Design Concepts

## Overview

This document outlines the key design concepts for the CertusBuild workspace interface. The workspace is the central hub where users will spend most of their time managing projects, creating estimates, and collaborating with team members.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Modularity** - The workspace should be highly modular, allowing users to customize their view based on their specific role and current tasks.

2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Information should be revealed progressively, showing only what's relevant at each stage of the workflow.

3. **Contextual Actions** - Tools and actions should be presented in context, reducing the need to navigate between different sections of the application.

4. **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear visual hierarchy should guide users' attention to the most important information and actions.

## Workspace Zones

The workspace is divided into several key zones:

### Navigation Zone
- Global navigation
- Project selector
- User profile and settings

### Context Zone
- Breadcrumbs
- Current project/task information
- Quick actions

### Main Work Area
- Dynamic content based on current task
- Multiple view options (list, board, timeline, etc.)
- Drag-and-drop interaction

### Tools Panel
- Context-sensitive tools
- Recently used items
- Quick access to resources

## Responsive Considerations

The workspace design accommodates various device sizes:

- **Desktop** - Full functionality with optimal layout for productivity
- **Tablet** - Simplified layout with core functionality preserved
- **Mobile** - Essential features with streamlined UI for on-the-go access

## Next Steps

- Prototype key workflows in high-fidelity mockups
- Conduct usability testing with target users
- Refine design based on feedback
- Develop component library for implementation
